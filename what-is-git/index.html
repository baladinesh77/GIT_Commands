  <h1>What is Git?</h1>
  <h3> In a nutshell, Git is a Version Control System (VCS) </h3>
  <h2> Questions?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>What is VCS?
    <p>
      Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of
      files over time so that you can recall specific versions later easily,
      suppose you are a code developer and want to keep every version of code
      or after some class complation (each time the project reaches a state you
      want to record), a Version Control System (VCS) is a very wise thing to use.
      It allows you to revert files back to a previous state, compare changes over
      time, it allow you the other developer code changes, see who modified over
      the time, who has done more numbers of line of code, statistics of the repository,
      who has done the code with bug and when, and many more, basically you can
      entirely do the tracking of the files over the time and go back to any
      previous changes.
